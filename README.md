PHP is a popular general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to
web development. Fast, flexible and pragmatic, PHP powers everything from your
blog to the most popular websites in the world. PHP is distributed under the
[PHP License v3.01](LICENSE).

## Documentation

The PHP manual is available at [php.net/docs](https://php.net/docs).

## Installation

### Prebuilt packages and binaries

Prebuilt packages and binaries can be used to get up and running fast with PHP.

For Windows, the PHP binaries can be obtained from
[windows.php.net](https://windows.php.net). After extracting the archive the
`*.exe` files are ready to use.

For other systems, see the [installation chapter](https://php.net/install).

### Building PHP source code

*For Windows, see [Build your own PHP on Windows](https://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild_sdk_2).*

For a minimal PHP build from Git, you will need autoconf, bison, and re2c. For
a default build, you will additionally need libxml2 and libsqlite3.

On Ubuntu, you can install these using:

    sudo apt install -y pkg-config build-essential autoconf bison re2c \
                        libxml2-dev libsqlite3-dev

On Fedora, you can install these using:

    sudo dnf install re2c bison autoconf make libtool ccache libxml2-devel sqlite-devel

Generate configure:

    ./buildconf

Configure your build. `--enable-debug` is recommended for development, see
`./configure --help` for a full list of options.

    # For development
    ./configure --enable-debug
    # For production
    ./configure

Build PHP. To speed up the build, specify the maximum number of jobs using `-j`:

    make -j4

The number of jobs should usually match the number of available cores, which
can be determined using `nproc`.

## Testing PHP source code

PHP ships with an extensive test suite, the command `make test` is used after
successful compilation of the sources to run this test suite.

It is possible to run tests using multiple cores by setting `-jN` in
`TEST_PHP_ARGS`:

    make TEST_PHP_ARGS=-j4 test

Shall run `make test` with a maximum of 4 concurrent jobs: Generally the maximum
number of jobs should not exceed the number of cores available.

The [qa.php.net](https://qa.php.net) site provides more detailed info about
testing and quality assurance.

## Installing PHP built from source

After a successful build (and test), PHP may be installed with:

    make install

Depending on your permissions and prefix, `make install` may need super user
permissions.
